# Tools for Language Learning

I am an avid language learner, and part of what helps me master rules and patterns is representing them as functions. This repository is my collection of said functions, which I hope can aid other learners.<br>

Currently, the following languages are supported:
* <a href="https://github.com/alisonykim/language-learning-tools/tree/main/fi" target="_blank">Finnish</a>

If you are an advanced or native speaker of any of the supported languages and spot a mistake or an edge case not covered by my rules, please let me know.<br>

Happy language learning!
