"""
Master Finnish consonant gradation (FI: "astevaihtelu"), the phenomenon of certain consonants undergoing change when adding particular case endings to words.

WORDTYPE A GRADATION occurs when the nominative form (base) is STRONG. The last syllable becomes closed and transforms the following STRONG endings:
	S1. nominative singular
	S2. partitive
	S3. illative
	S4. essive
	S5. comitative
into one of the following WEAK endings:
	W1. nominative plural: "-t"
	W2. genitive: "-n"
	W3. inessive: "-ssa/ss채"
	W4. elative: "-sta/st채",
	W5. adessive: "-lla/ll채"
	W6. ablative: "-lta/lt채"
	W7. allative: "-lle"
	W8. translative: "-ksi"
	W9. abessive: "-tta"
	W10. instructive: "-in"
